# {{FEATURE_NAME}}

> **When to use**: During the PRD phase, every new feature identified in `research/PRD.md` must have its own features document created from this template. One feature = one doc = one implementation unit. Do not code a PRD scope item without a corresponding features doc.

> **Status**: Draft / In Progress / Blocked / Done

## 3. Tasks

> Every task must have a verification method. When a subagent is needed, define its role and write set first.

| # | Task | Owner | Write Set | Verify |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | {{WRITE_FAILING_TEST_OR_DOC_CHECK}} | {{OWNER}} | `{{PATH}}` | `{{COMMAND_OR_CHECK}}` |
| 2 | {{IMPLEMENT_MINIMAL_CHANGE}} | {{OWNER}} | `{{PATH}}` | `{{COMMAND_OR_CHECK}}` |
| 3 | {{SYNC_DOCS_OR_BOUNDARIES}} | {{OWNER}} | `{{PATH}}` | `{{COMMAND_OR_CHECK}}` |

### Subagent Plan (required — justify if all No)

Estimate the context budget for this feature. If the main agent would need to read >5 files or modify >3 files, subagents are mandatory per `.claude/rules/ecc/common.md`.

| Agent / Pass | Required? | Mode | Read Boundary | Write Set | Verify |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Planner | {{YES_NO}} | Parallel Read | `{{SCOPE}}` | none | `{{CHECK}}` |
| Researcher / Docs Researcher | {{YES_NO}} | Parallel Read | `{{SCOPE}}` | none | `{{CHECK}}` |
| Architect | {{YES_NO}} | Parallel Read | `{{SCOPE}}` | none | `{{CHECK}}` |
| Explorer Pass | {{YES_NO}} | Parallel Read | `{{SCOPE}}` | none | `{{CHECK}}` |
| Test Writer | {{YES_NO}} | Serial Write | `{{SCOPE}}` | `{{PATH}}` | `{{COMMAND}}` |
| Implementer / Debugger | {{YES_NO}} | Serial Write | `{{SCOPE}}` | `{{PATH}}` | `{{COMMAND}}` |
| Reviewer | {{YES_NO}} | Parallel Read | `{{SCOPE}}` | none | `{{CHECK}}` |
| Verifier | {{YES_NO}} | Parallel Read | `{{SCOPE}}` | none | `{{COMMANDS}}` |

**If all roles are No, justify:** {{WHY_MAIN_AGENT_CAN_HANDLE_ALONE}}
