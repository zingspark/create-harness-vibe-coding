# Agent Workflow

Use when implementing, reviewing, debugging, or coordinating subagents.

## ReAct Loop

```text
Observe -> Load minimal context -> Plan -> Act -> Verify -> Update docs/harness/PLAN.md
```

If context grows, load [context-loading.md](context-loading.md) and split the work. If more than one agent is useful, load [dispatch.md](dispatch.md).

## Feature Packet

Every PRD scope item (`research/PRD.md` Section 2) must have its own feature doc at `docs/features/<name>.md` created from `docs/features/_template.md`. One feature = one doc = one implementation unit. Do not code without a feature doc.

Small scope is not an exception — a short feature doc is better than none. If the work is truly too small for a full feature doc (single-file fix, no behavior change), it is not a PRD scope item.

**New vs iterate**: if a PRD scope item has ≥85% overlap with an existing feature doc, open the existing doc, bump `Version`, and add a `## Changelog` entry. Only create a new file when the scope is substantially different. When unsure, ask.

## Standard Build Loop

```text
PRD/feature packet
-> failing test or manual check
-> minimal implementation
-> verification
-> review
-> docs sync
-> close or iterate
```

## Subagent Use

Use subagents when a task needs broad reading, parallel work, cross-layer changes, independent review, or isolated debugging.

Before spawn, define:

- role
- task
- mode
- read boundary
- write boundary
- dependency
- injected docs from [context-loading.md](context-loading.md)
- return format

Rules:

- Explorer Pass, Reviewer, and Verifier are read-only.
- Researcher and Docs Researcher are read-only unless explicitly asked to return a docs patch.
- Planner and Architect are read-only unless explicitly asked to return a docs patch.
- Test Writer writes tests before Implementer writes production code.
- Implementer only writes inside its declared write set.
- Writing agents run serially unless write sets are disjoint.
- Debugger fixes the smallest failing path, not adjacent design.
- Main agent integrates summaries, resolves conflicts, and runs final verification.

## Parallel Dispatch

Use [dispatch.md](dispatch.md) for multi-agent work. Default to at most three active agents. Prefer parallel read-only work first, then serial writes.

Every dispatched agent returns the handoff format defined in [dispatch.md](dispatch.md).

## Conflict Rule

If PRD, docs/harness/PLAN.md, architecture, ports, tests, or code disagree:

1. stop implementation
2. record the conflict in `docs/harness/PLAN.md` or the feature doc
3. choose the smallest reversible decision
4. ask the maintainer when user-visible behavior or security is affected

## Completion Gate

Close only when:

- acceptance criteria are satisfied
- verification evidence is recorded
- architecture, ports, data-flow, or state docs are synced if affected
- no unresolved critical/high review findings remain
- `docs/harness/PLAN.md` states the final status or next iteration
