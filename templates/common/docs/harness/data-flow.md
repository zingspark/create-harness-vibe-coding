# Data Flow — {{projectName}}

> **Purpose**: Define the complete lifecycle of each event/request — happy path + all failure branches.
> **This is the most important file in the entire docs folder** — what AI most often invents during implementation is failure-path behavior. Write it clearly and it won't.
>
> Philosophy source: EventCatalog pattern + arc42 Chapter 6 (Runtime View).

## 1. Event Catalog

| Event Type | Producer | Consumer | Payload Key Fields | Delivery Semantics | Ordering Requirements |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `{{EVENT_1}}` | `{{PRODUCER}}` | `{{CONSUMERS}}` | `{{KEY_FIELDS}}` | {{SEMANTICS}} | {{ORDERING}} |

## 2. Core Flows

### 2.1 Happy Path

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Caller
    participant Runner
    participant Bus as EventBus/Audit
    participant Port1 as {{PORT_NAME_1}}
    participant Port2 as {{PORT_NAME_2}}

    Caller->>Runner: {{ENTRY_POINT}}
    Runner->>Bus: publish {{START_EVENT}}
    Runner->>Port1: {{ACTION_1}}
    Port1-->>Runner: {{RESULT_1}}
    Runner->>Port2: {{ACTION_2}}
    Port2-->>Runner: {{RESULT_2}}
    Runner->>Bus: publish {{END_EVENT}}
    Runner-->>Caller: {{FINAL_RESULT}}
```

### 2.2 Failure Paths

Each failure point must clearly document:
- **Trigger condition**
- **System behavior**
- **Event publishing**
- **Caller perception**
- **Recovery method**

## 3. Error Handling Conventions

- **Retryable errors**: {{POLICY}}
- **Non-retryable errors**: {{POLICY}}
- **Silent ignore**: {{POLICY}}
