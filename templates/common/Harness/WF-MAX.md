# WF-MAX — Maximum Parallelism Workflow

**WF-MAX is a three-layer architecture: global mode (`wf-max`), agent role (`ceo|manager|worker|reviewer`), dispatch permission (`writeSet`, `forbidden`, `verification`). Global mode ≠ every agent is CEO.**

```
CEO CONTRACT (top-level orchestrator only — Workers follow their dispatch packet):

ALLOWED first actions:
1. Read CLAUDE.md, Harness/MEMORY.md, Harness/README.md, Harness/WF-MAX.md
2. Create task PLAN/PROGRESS
3. Spawn W0 read-only agents in ONE message

FORBIDDEN before W0 returns:
- Read source files deeply (scoping only via Grep/Glob)
- Edit / Write / MultiEdit on source files
- Bash (except ls/dir/tree/git status/git diff)

FORBIDDEN always (unless writing PLAN.md/PROGRESS.md):
- Edit / Write / MultiEdit on source files — delegate to Workers with explicit writeSet

Workers: edit only files in dispatch.writeSet. Outside writeSet → blocked.
Managers: scope, coordinate. No source edits. Reviewers: read only.

If tempted to Read/Edit/Bash a source file → STOP. Spawn a Worker.
```

## Trigger

- Explicit: `/wf-max [task]`
- Auto: WF task with write-set ≥5 files AND clear disjoint boundaries
- parallelismScore = (files × avgLines × 3 / 800) × independenceFactor
  - spawn ≥2.0 | maybe 1.0-2.0 | skip <1.0 (degrade to /wf)

## Explicit Invocation Is an Absolute Fan-Out Mandate

When the user types `/wf-max` (or `wf max`), spawning subagents is **mandatory and unconditional**. File count, task size, line count, and overhead estimates DO NOT apply to explicit invocation — they govern ONLY auto-triggering (whether the harness enters wf-max on its own). A 1-file task invoked with `/wf-max` still fans out to parallel subagents.

"Degrade to /wf" changes the **organization** (flat vs CEO→Manager→Worker), never the **fact** of fan-out: `/wf` itself requires ≥3 subagents before second planning. There is no path from an explicitly typed command to a solo main-thread pass. If you find yourself reading source files and editing them directly after the user typed `/wf-max`, you have violated this mandate — stop and dispatch.

- [dispatch.md](dispatch.md) — handoff format, File claim, Concurrency group fields
- [agent-workflow.md](agent-workflow.md) — build/test/review loop, cohesion rule, completion gate

## Organization Model

```
CEO(1) ──┬── Manager₁(span) ──┬── Worker₁..ₙ
         │                     └── Sub-Manager(span) → Worker₁..ₙ  [depth ≥3]
         └── Manager₂(span) ── Worker₁..ₙ
```

- CEO: intent, scope, integration, final verification. Direct reports 3-5 Managers. **CEO never writes code directly** — dispatch Workers for all file changes. CEO only synthesizes results and decides next waves.
- Manager: domain partition → parallel dispatch → synthesize → report. Serial across domains; parallel within domain. **Manager agents must be defined by the project** (not shipped by the harness) — create them under `.claude/agents/` with the `Agent` tool enabled for nested spawning.
- Worker: single file per write Worker (implementer, one file_claim). Single dimension/topic per read Worker (reviewer, researcher). File claims must be file-level disjoint. Topic-level splitting within a single file is only allowed for read-only Workers.
- depth ≥3: Manager spawns Sub-Manager (span ≤7) instead of Worker. Recursive until leaf condition met.

## Decomposition Gate (MANDATORY — CEO-level, before ANY Worker dispatch)

The Decomposition Gate is a hard stop. No code changes, no Worker spawns until the gate passes. The CEO MUST produce a Dispatch Table artifact and pass the Self-Audit Checklist. This is the single most important enforcement mechanism in WF-MAX — it exists because **models default to "do it myself" rather than "decompose and delegate."**

### Gate Artifact: Dispatch Table

CEO MUST write this table in the task PLAN.md after W1 architecture defines the write-set and before W2 implementation dispatch:

```
| File | Concern | Worker Type | Worker Label | Read-Only? |
|------|---------|------------|--------------|------------|
| src/a.ts | Auth middleware | implementer | impl-auth | No |
| src/b.ts | DB schema | implementer | impl-db | No |
| docs/arch.md | Research existing patterns | researcher | res-arch | Yes |
```

### Gate Rules (any violation = gate fail, retry)

1. **Every file in the write-set MUST have exactly one write Worker.** Unassigned files = fail. This is the anti-bundling rule — one Worker touching >1 write file = fail. (Read Workers may span multiple files.)
2. **Manager count MUST ≥ span_min = ceil(sqrt(write_files) / 3).** This is the anti-under-decomposition rule at the domain level. Fewer than the minimum number of Managers means domains are too coarse. "One Manager can handle everything" is NOT valid in WF-MAX — if the task were that simple, degrade to /wf.
3. **Each Manager MUST have ≥2 Workers and ≤7 Workers.** 0-1 Workers = Phantom Manager → dissolve. >7 Workers → Manager context is overloaded → split the domain and add a Manager.
4. **CEO MUST NOT appear as a Worker row.** CEO writes no production code — fail.

### CEO Tool Boundary

The CEO operates under a strict tool restriction model for production code:

| CEO Has | CEO MUST NOT Use (on source code) |
|---------|-----------------------------------|
| Task (spawn agents) | Edit (on source files) |
| Read (for scoping) | Write (on source files) |
| TodoWrite (tracking) | Bash (except final verification) |
| Grep/Glob (for scoping) | MultiEdit (on source files) |

**Exception**: CEO MAY write to `Harness/tasks/<id>/PLAN.md` and `Harness/tasks/<id>/PROGRESS.md` — these are task-tracking artifacts, not production code. The Dispatch Table, Self-Audit Checklist, and synthesis reports are the CEO's primary durable artifacts.

If the CEO finds itself reaching for Edit/Write/Bash on source files, it is violating role boundaries. Stop. Delegate to a Worker.

### Self-Audit Checklist

After producing the Dispatch Table, CEO MUST answer all before proceeding:

- [ ] Did I assign myself any source file? (must be **No** — PLAN.md/PROGRESS.md writes are the exception)
- [ ] Is every file with planned changes assigned to exactly one write Worker? (must be **Yes**)
- [ ] Does any Worker have >1 write file? (must be **No**)
- [ ] Is Manager count ≥ ceil(sqrt(write_files) / 3)? (must be **Yes**, or justification written)
- [ ] Does every Manager have 2-7 Workers? (<2 = Phantom Manager, >7 = overloaded)
- [ ] Are there files >200 lines or with >1 concern that should be split into separate files?
- [ ] Could any serial chain be parallelized? (different files with no shared imports = parallelize)
- [ ] Will all Workers be spawned in ONE message?

Gate retries until all checks pass. **CEO may NOT proceed to W1 with a failing gate.**

## Anti-Pattern Catalog

Before every wave dispatch, CEO MUST scan for these patterns. **Any match = stop and re-decompose.**

| # | Anti-Pattern | Symptom | Detection | Fix |
|---|-------------|---------|-----------|-----|
| AP1 | **CEO-as-Worker** | CEO assigns itself a file or starts writing code | CEO in Dispatch Table; Edit/Write/Bash used by CEO | Re-delegate to a Worker immediately |
| AP2 | **Under-decomposition** | Fewer Workers than `ceil(sqrt(files))` | Count check fails; "1-2 agents is enough for this" | Split files by concern, module, or layer |
| AP3 | **Serialization trap** | "Let me do X first, then I'll know how to dispatch Y" | Sequential plan without parallel candidates | Dispatch X and Y in parallel NOW; Worker-X returns spec that Worker-Y consumes |
| AP4 | **Fake parallelism** | Multiple Workers assigned same file | Duplicate file path in Dispatch Table | One file = one Writer. Split file into separate modules, or serialize |
| AP5 | **Phantom Manager** | Manager spawns 0-1 Workers | Manager's sub-table has <2 Workers | Dissolve Manager; CEO or sibling absorbs domain |
| AP6 | **Sequential spawn** | Workers spawned one-per-turn instead of batched | Only 1 Task() call per message | Batch ALL Task() calls into ONE message |
| AP7 | **Silent degrade** | CEO switches to /wf without recording reason | No Dispatch Table; flat agent spawns | Explicit decision + justification in PLAN.md; only valid reason is overhead > 0.30 |

## Span Formula (Prescriptive Floor)

```
Manager_min = ceil(sqrt(write_files) / 3)   # HARD FLOOR — you MUST have ≥ this many Managers
Manager_max = min(Manager_min × 2, 7)       # per-wave; exceed only with written justification
Worker_max_per_manager = 7                   # hard cap; split domain if exceeded

Worker count per wave = write_files (one Worker per write file, guaranteed by Gate Rule #1)

Domain caps (workers per Manager by type):
  Architecture:    cap = 3
  Implementation:  cap = 7
  Review:          cap = 10
  Research:        cap = 12
```

**Manager_min is a floor, not a target.** The span formula prevents domain-level under-decomposition — the real failure mode where one Manager tries to coordinate too many Workers across unrelated concerns. Worker-level under-decomposition is prevented by Gate Rule #1 (one file per Worker).

## Total Agents (recursive, scales to 1000)

```
total(depth, span) = Σ span^L for L=0..depth
```

- depth=0: CEO + Workers only (XS)
- depth=1: CEO + Managers + Workers
- depth=2: CEO + Managers + Workers
- depth≥3: CEO + Managers + Sub-Managers + Workers (recursive)
- no hard agent cap; recursion governed by leaf condition + overhead filter

## Sizing Table

| Scale | Files   | Depth | CEO | Mgrs | Workers | Total |
|-------|---------|-------|-----|------|---------|-------|
| XS    | 1-4     | 0     | 1   | 0    | 1-3     | 2-4   |
| S     | 5-12    | 1     | 1   | 2    | 6       | 9     |
| M     | 13-30   | 1     | 1   | 3    | 15      | 19    |
| L     | 31-60   | 2     | 1   | 5    | 35      | 41    |
| XL    | 61-200  | 2     | 1   | 7    | 49      | 57    |
| XXL   | 201-500 | 3     | 1   | 7    | 343     | 351   |
| XXXL  | 501-1000| 3     | 1   | 7    | 686     | 694   |

- depth≥3: Managers spawn Sub-Managers (span≤7). No mixed Worker+Sub-Manager dispatch in same wave.

## Leaf Condition (stop splitting)

- files ≤ span×2
- OR avgLines < 50
- OR overhead > 0.30 (degrade to /wf)

## Manager Types (4)

| Type          | Trigger                       | Span | Worker Roles                                                  |
|---------------|-------------------------------|------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Architect-Mgr | cross-file interfaces, new ports | 3  | boundary-researcher, interface-designer, data-flow-mapper     |
| Implement-Mgr | write-set defined             | 5-7  | implementer₁..ₙ (1 file_claim each)                           |
| Review-Mgr    | implementation wave complete  | 3-4  | reviewer-spec, reviewer-code, reviewer-security               |
| Explore-Mgr   | L+ project, uncertain scope   | 5-10 | researcher₁..ₙ, domain-explorer₁..ₙ                           |

## Manager Synthesis Protocol

```
1. COLLECT      → await all Worker returns
2. DEDUPLICATE  → dedupe, merge overlap
3. CONFLICT     → flag contradictions (file_claim overlap, interface mismatch); no silent resolve
4. SYNTHESIZE   → single integrated artifact
5. REPORT       → CEO-actionable synthesis + raw Worker returns (audit)
```

- Worker failure: retry 1× → on 2nd failure, Manager absorbs or escalates to CEO for replan.

## Wave Orchestration

```
W0:    Explore-Mgr    → N parallel researchers → synthesize → CEO
E-GATE:               → Exploration Gate: CEO verifies all exploration questions answered, findings synthesized (lightweight; see WF.md Decomposition Gate)
W1:    Architect-Mgr  → 3 parallel → boundary decisions + interface contract → CEO approval
D-GATE:               → Write Decomposition Gate: CEO produces Dispatch Table + Self-Audit → GATE PASS/FAIL (MANDATORY, applied to the write-set defined by architecture)
W2:    Implement-Mgr  → write-set coloring → wave dispatch: ALL Workers spawned in ONE message → merge → CEO
W2R:   Review-Mgr     → 3-4 parallel reviewers → dedupe + severity → CEO assigns fixes
W3+:   Dependent waves (repeat W2 pattern; re-run D-GATE if write-set changed significantly)
INTEGRATION: CEO → verifier → fail → debugger → loop (cap=3)
CLOSEOUT:   CEO → context-master + memory-master (direct, no Manager)
```

- **E-GATE** (Exploration Gate): read-only agents each had a specific question; all returns are synthesized into PLAN.md. No exploration blind spots.
- **D-GATE** (Write Decomposition Gate): applies AFTER architecture defines the write-set, BEFORE any implementation Worker spawns. Dispatch Table covers the actual write-set. Gate is non-negotiable.
- W2 dispatch: ALL Workers for a wave MUST be spawned in a single message — not one per turn. Batching is what makes parallelism real.

- Wave scheduling: Managers serial across domains, Workers parallel within domain.
- CEO validates wave output before starting next wave. No pipelining.

## Overhead & Cost Filter

```
overhead(depth) = 0.10 (depth≤2) | 0.20 (depth=3) | 0.35 (depth≥4)
```

- overhead > 0.30 → degrade to /wf
- independenceFactor: 1.0 (no deps) | 0.3-0.7 (shared imports)

## When NOT to use /wf-max

These conditions govern **auto-trigger degradation only** (wf-max → /wf). They never apply when the user explicitly types `/wf-max`, and "degrade" always means the flat /wf multi-subagent loop, never a solo pass.

- files < 5 → use /wf
- all changes share single interface → serial dependency
- import/re-export refactor → global consistency required
- communication overhead > 30% → degrade

## /wf vs /wf-max

| Dimension        | /wf              | /wf-max                          |
|------------------|------------------|----------------------------------|
| Organization     | flat             | CEO → Mgr → Worker (3-tier)      |
| Exploration      | 3-5 serial       | Mgr → 10 parallel                |
| Implementation   | 1 serial         | Mgr → N parallel (span 5-7)      |
| Review           | 1-2 serial gate  | Mgr → 3-4 parallel dimensions    |
| Span formula     | none             | sqrt(files) + domain cap         |
| Recursive depth  | 0                | 1-3 (scales to 1000 agents)      |
| Context threshold| ~85%             | ~70%                             |
| Granularity floor| none             | <50 lines → no split             |
