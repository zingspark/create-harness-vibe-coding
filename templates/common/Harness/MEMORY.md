# MEMORY.md - create-harness-vibe-coding Project Resource Index

> `CLAUDE.md` is the session entry router; `Harness/README.md` is the Harness documentation index. This file persists cross-session context: resource index, user preferences, tool usage standards.
> Detailed memory lives in `Harness/memory/`. Keep entries short, newest first, and free of secrets.

Stack-specific agents can be added after the product shape is known.

## Skills (Workflows)

- [WF Mode](specs/workflows/WF.md) - WF-KERNEL tiered orchestration: WF-Light (minimal roles), WF-Standard (adds review), WF-Full (complete role chain incl. reflector and cross-review).
- [wf](../.claude/skills/wf/SKILL.md) - Claude Code WF skill command; mirrored for Codex at `../.agents/skills/wf/SKILL.md`.
- [subagent-orchestrator](../.claude/skills/subagent-orchestrator/SKILL.md) - controller-led subagent orchestration, parallel read-only passes, review gates, and recovery handoffs.
- [wf-readme](../.claude/skills/wf-readme/SKILL.md) - README preservation, append-only development sections, structured tables, and approved architecture diagrams.
- [wf-agents-docs](../.claude/skills/wf-agents-docs/SKILL.md) - source-backed Claude/Codex/OpenCode CLI invocation, JSON output, resume, telemetry, and automation gotchas.
- [wf-review](../.claude/skills/wf-review/SKILL.md) - native-only peer review: the controller dispatches bounded clean reviewer subagents, deduplicates evidence, and decides.
- [wf-help](../.claude/skills/wf-help/SKILL.md) - Codex compatibility shim for `$wf-help` / `/skills wf-help`; returns the direct command table without entering WF.
- [wf-update](../.claude/skills/wf-update/SKILL.md) - GitHub-based incremental harness update, checksum comparison, and safe in-place updates.
- [wf-learn](../.claude/skills/wf-learn/SKILL.md) - explicit evidence-to-method learning cycle with anti-overfitting gate, route-load proof, and scoped memory writes.
- [wf-max](../.claude/skills/wf-max/SKILL.md) - WF kernel + evidence-driven fan-out: WF-Max-Useful may persist a no-spawn rationale when dependencies, acceptance, coordination, budget, or runtime evidence show no benefit; WF-Max-Strict is explicit only; current runtime capacity remains authoritative.
- [wf-auto](../.claude/skills/wf-auto/SKILL.md) - perpetual adaptive auto-optimization: evidence-selected probes, dynamic obligations, intent checkpoints, evidence ledger.
- [wf-auto-spark](../.claude/skills/wf-auto-spark/SKILL.md) - perpetual inspiration mode: external spark search, long-term roadmap with staged milestones, <=50% deviation guard.
- [wf-browser](../.claude/skills/wf-browser/SKILL.md) - built-in agent-operable browser architecture and runtime-control workflow with readiness levels, WebSocket bridge, UI capability contract, observe/act primitives, virtual cursor, multi-window/subagent leases, `Harness/wf-browser/` artifacts, and Playwright/CDP fallback.
- [wf-ui](../.claude/skills/wf-ui/SKILL.md) - Codex compatibility shim for `$wf-ui` / `/skills wf-ui`; direct command starts the local browser control panel without entering WF.
- [wf-init](../.claude/skills/wf-init/SKILL.md) - Codex compatibility shim for `$wf-init` / `/skills wf-init`; direct command initializes a project against the global Harness runtime without entering WF.
- [wf-search](../.claude/skills/wf-search/SKILL.md) - Codex compatibility shim for `$wf-search` / `/skills wf-search`; direct command validates and renders a structured search evidence report without entering WF.
- [tdd](../.claude/skills/tdd/SKILL.md) - acceptance-driven TDD: AC-linked RED tests, real UI clicks for browser-visible behavior, Playwright/CDP evidence, and configured coverage gate.
- [wf-remove](../.claude/skills/wf-remove/SKILL.md) - safely remove Harness framework files (SAFE/MODIFIED/USER classes), auto-prune empty directories, backup option.
- [wf-task-record](../.claude/skills/wf-task-record/SKILL.md) - Codex compatibility: use $wf-task-record or /skills wf-task-record to wrap task-state.mjs record.
- [wf-task-list](../.claude/skills/wf-task-list/SKILL.md) - Codex compatibility: use $wf-task-list or /skills wf-task-list to wrap task-state.mjs list.
- [wf-task-archive](../.claude/skills/wf-task-archive/SKILL.md) - Codex compatibility: use $wf-task-archive or /skills wf-task-archive to wrap task-state.mjs archive.
- [wf-command-create](../.claude/skills/wf-command-create/SKILL.md) - Codex compatibility: use $wf-command-create or /skills wf-command-create to update command surfaces from `command-surface.json`.

Codex repo-skill mirrors live under `../.agents/skills/` with the same skill names.

## Direct Commands

- [wf-update](../.claude/commands/wf-update.md) - direct `/wf-update` command for script-driven update checks, safe apply, conflict handling, and release highlights.
- [wf-task-record](../.claude/commands/wf-task-record.md) - direct `/wf-task-record` command that wraps `node Harness/scripts/task-state.mjs record`.
- [wf-task-list](../.claude/commands/wf-task-list.md) - direct `/wf-task-list` command that wraps `node Harness/scripts/task-state.mjs list`.
- [wf-task-archive](../.claude/commands/wf-task-archive.md) - direct `/wf-task-archive` command that wraps `node Harness/scripts/task-state.mjs archive`.
- [wf-command-create](../.claude/commands/wf-command-create.md) - direct `/wf-command-create` command for task-backed wf-* command surface changes.
- [wf-ui](../.claude/commands/wf-ui.md) - direct `/wf-ui` command that starts the local Harness backend and browser control panel.
- [wf-init](../.claude/commands/wf-init.md) - direct `/wf-init` command that binds the current project to the globally installed Harness runtime (thin bridge; global version is authoritative).

Stack-specific skills can be added after the product shape is known.

## Memory Folder

> L2 startup digest: `memory/startup-hints.md` — lightweight hints loaded at session start.
> L3 route index: `memory/routes.md` — scenario hit-rules index (not detailed memory).
> L3 detailed files: loaded only when scenario matches via routes.

- [Startup hints](memory/startup-hints.md) - L2 lightweight startup digest (5-10 hints, no dates). Loaded at Harness session start; not a replacement for full router.
- [Memory routes](memory/routes.md) - L3 route index with signals/scoring/avoid rules. Not detailed memory — hit-rules only.
- [Tool usage/reflections](memory/tool-usage-reflections.md) - repeated tool failures, better command patterns, environment-specific fixes.
- [User corrections/preferences](memory/user-corrections-preferences.md) - repeated user corrections, durable preferences, common-sense course corrections.
- [Agent lessons/patterns](memory/agent-lessons-patterns.md) - reusable lessons from review, debugging, validation, and handoff loops.

Write to the memory folder when the guidance should survive chat context loss:

- Use `memory/tool-usage-reflections.md` when the same tool/use pattern fails 3+ times, a better command pattern is found, or an environment-specific fix should be reused.
- Use `memory/user-corrections-preferences.md` when the user explicitly asks to remember a preference, or the user corrects the same assumption/pattern 2+ times.
- Use `memory/agent-lessons-patterns.md` when a review/debug loop yields a reusable lesson or regression guard.
- Use this file for the resource index and routing pointers, not long-form lessons.
- Never record secrets, credentials, tokens, or private data. If a memory is ambiguous, ask before writing.
