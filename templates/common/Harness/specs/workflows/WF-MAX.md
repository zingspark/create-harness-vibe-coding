# WF-MAX — Maximum Safe Parallelism

`/wf-max` = `/wf` kernel + maximum safe fan-out. It is NOT a separate workflow. It is a parallelism superset of `/wf` and inherits the full [WF-KERNEL.md](WF-KERNEL.md) orchestration engine and [WF.md](WF.md) tier contract, then expands execution through a three-layer architecture (CEO → Manager → Worker) with dispatch permissions (writeSet, forbidden, verification). Global mode != every agent is CEO.

WF-MAX is **explicit only**. Enter ONLY when the user explicitly types `/wf-max`, `$wf-max`, or `/skills wf-max`.

## Delta from /wf

| Dimension | /wf | /wf-max |
|---|---|---|
| Orchestration | Ready-queue, tier-gated | Same ready-queue + max decomposition |
| Exploration | codebase-explorer fan-out | explore-manager → 5-10 researchers |
| Architecture | architect (when triggered) | architect-manager → 3 architects |
| Implementation | One implementer per wave | implement-manager → 5-7 implementers (one file_claim each) |
| Review | Reviewer(s) per wave | review-manager → 3-4 parallel reviewers |
| State | Controller or task-scribe | task-scribe continuously maintains dispatch ledger |
| Source edits | Implementer writes | Workers write ONLY dispatch.writeSet; CEO never writes source |

The manager ranges above describe available role shapes, not a fixed headcount.
WF-Max-Useful chooses no spawn or a cheap role pass when dependency, acceptance,
coordination, budget, or runtime evidence makes fan-out uneconomic.

## Fan-Out Modes

**WF-Max-Useful** (default): the CEO makes an evidence-based spawn decision
from dependency shape, independent acceptance, expected coordination benefit,
token/time budget, and actual runtime capacity. A dependency chain, no
independent acceptance, or coordination cost without measurable benefit is a
valid no-spawn outcome. Persist `fanoutSuppressed: true`, the reason, and the
budget/capacity evidence in the task ledger. This does not authorize CEO source edits;
required production changes still go through a Worker.

**WF-Max-Strict** (explicit `--strict`, `strict wf-max`, or `strict mode`):
unconditional fan-out per the span formula, bounded by real runtime capacity.
Strict mode attempts native fan-out first; on a failure record
`fanoutAttempted: true`, runtime/channel, requested roles, limits, failure, and
fallback in task state. Strict mode is never inferred from task size.

## Mandatory Fan-Out Contract (Strict mode only)

The mandatory portion of this contract applies only after an explicit
`--strict`, `strict wf-max`, or `strict mode` request. In that mode the
controller MUST attempt native subagent fan-out before implementation planning
is considered complete, bounded by the real runtime capacity. Useful mode may
record a no-spawn decision and does not inherit this requirement.

## Context and Research Contract

Before planning or dispatch, generate the bounded task input:

```text
node Harness/scripts/task-context.mjs pack <task-id> --project <absolutePath> --role <role> --budget-bytes <n> --json
```

The controller passes the role/work-item pack to each Worker. Resume consumes a
new `show`/`pack` instead of the full task log; `--input` is optional for pack.
Before any external lookup, run:

```text
node Harness/scripts/research-policy.mjs decide --trigger <trigger> --task-type <type> --json
```

Search current web, GitHub, or Hugging Face primary sources only when the result
has `search: true`. Record URL, title, version, license, checked date, and an
`adopt`, `adapt`, or `reject` rationale. Reuse local evidence when no trigger
exists; do not force network research or full-memory loading.

OpenCode-specific requirement: project `opencode.json` must set `subagent_depth >= 2` for manager -> worker nesting, and WF-MAX manager agents must expose `permission.task` allowlists for their child agents. Without those two settings, OpenCode may accept `/wf-max` but fail to fan out from manager subagents.

## CEO Contract

CEO reads, plans, dispatches, synthesizes, and writes task state only.
- **CEO never writes production source code.** All source edits are delegated to Workers.
- Any new task capsule uses `task-<verb>-<noun>[-detail]` under
  `Harness/tasks/<task-id>/`; never use bare `fix-*` task ids.
- When updating `Harness/PROGRESS.md`, preserve required headings such as
  `## Active Task`, `## Task Index`, and `## Cross-Task Decisions`; append or
  update rows instead of replacing the file skeleton.
- CEO spawns task-scribe (haiku) by default to maintain dispatch ledger, heartbeat, and evidence pointers; if unavailable, CEO records the degradation and writes only the smallest durable checkpoint.
- CEO may spawn codebase-explorer(s) (haiku) for scoped source discovery.

## Worker Channel Degradation & Independence

WF-MAX Workers MUST execute as **independent agent contexts** — never as in-process tool calls from the CEO thread. When a worker channel is unavailable, degrade honestly; never disguise an in-process tool call as a Worker.

### Independence Levels

| Channel | Independence | Counts as Worker? |
|---|---|---|
| native subagent (Agent-tool dispatch) | independent | yes |
| peer CLI (`claude -p`, `codex exec`, `opencode run`) | independent (separate process) | yes |
| MCP tools (`mcp__codex.codex_implement`, `mcp__claude.claude_implement`, etc.) | inprocess (CEO thread) | NEVER |

### Degradation Chain

When delegating source edits to a Worker, try channels in order; descend on failure; when all independent channels are unavailable, stop honestly and ask the user — do NOT fall back to an in-process MCP tool:

0. **Use proven channels only** — prefer the current runtime's native subagent channel when it has already returned successfully in this session. If a peer CLI is needed, follow `.claude/skills/wf-agents-docs/SKILL.md`, keep output on stdout, and return an Evidence-Packet instead of scratch files.
1. native subagent (preferred — independent context, bounded writeSet)
2. `claude -p` peer CLI (independent process)
3. `codex exec` peer CLI (independent process)
4. all unavailable → honest pause + human escalation (record blocker in task PROGRESS.md)

### Hard Prohibition

`mcp__codex.codex_implement`, `mcp__claude.claude_implement`, and any CEO-thread MCP tool call MUST NOT be recorded or used as Worker execution. An in-process tool call has no independent context boundary and no enforced writeSet — using it and logging "CEO did not edit source" is fake compliance. Historical instance: `tasks/task-framework-metrics-and-entry-contract/PLAN.md:791`.

### Timeout & Retry

Every Worker dispatch or peer-CLI call must be bounded by the controller's command timeout. A Worker dispatch that returns `unavailable-timeout` or `unavailable-error` (transient) is retried **once**; a second failure descends to the next channel in the chain. WF-MAX MUST NEVER hang on an unresponsive channel (historical failure: a 300s Codex read-only query hang, `tasks/task-framework-metrics-and-entry-contract/PLAN.md`). Bounded calls + single retry + honest descent replace silent hangs.

### Capability Evidence

Record the channel actually used, command/tool form, timeout, exit status, and a <=250 token Evidence-Packet in the task capsule. Do not create ad hoc probe scripts or write peer-CLI output to `%TEMP%`; persistent evidence belongs only under the current task's `evidence/` directory when it is intentionally part of the task record.

### Peer CLI Output Contract

- `opencode run --agent reviewer`: installed agent is `mode: subagent` per `.opencode/agents/reviewer.md`. Do NOT claim primary-runner role use without a live probe.
- Parse JSON/JSONL peer CLI output: fail on empty/non-JSON, error events, budget errors, fallback warnings, or missing final model text.

## Parallelism Priority

1. Read-only exploration — max parallel, all readSets
2. Docs/research — max parallel
3. Test design — max parallel
4. Implementation — parallel only when writeSets are DISJOINT
5. WriteSet conflicts → sequential wave, patch-only return, or worktree/branch isolation
6. Review — parallel per-wave when verifier evidence is ready
7. Idle capacity → immediately dispatch next ready item from queue

## Span Formula (WF-Max-Strict)

```
Manager_min = max(1, ceil(write_files / 7), ceil(sqrt(write_files) / 2))
Manager_max = min(max(Manager_min * 2, Manager_min), 7)
```

## Worker Discipline

- One file_claim per write Worker
- WriteSet must be disjoint across parallel Workers
- Workers return <=250 tokens + evidence/file paths
- task-scribe (haiku) runs alongside any wave when available; process-file delegation is the default, not a token-heavy CEO formatting task

## Token Budget and Fan-Out Caps

WF-MAX fan-out is bounded. Unbounded worker dispatch is forbidden.

- **Total worker cap**: Maximum 15 agents per WF-MAX task (all waves combined). Managers, reviewers, and verifiers count toward this cap. Read-only scouts and task-scribe do not count.
- **Per-wave cap**: Maximum 7 Workers per implementation wave (enforced by implement-manager span formula).
- **Reviewer cap**: Maximum 4 reviewers per wave (review-manager).
- **Manager cap**: Maximum 4 Managers total (explore, architect, implement, review).
- **Token budget**: If `budget.total` is set (user-specified budget), CEO MUST reserve >=30% for review/verify/reflect phases. Stop dispatching Workers when remaining budget is below 50k tokens.
- **Overflow discipline**: Cross-CLI overflow (Codex → Claude, Claude → Codex) is allowed only after native subagent pool is genuinely exhausted (not just busy). Each overflow dispatch costs context; prefer closing completed agents first.
- **Idle workers**: Close completed agents before declaring the pool exhausted. Do not spawn new workers while idle capacity is available.

## Runtime Capacity Map

Harness treats vendor/runtime limits as outer ceilings, not as permission to exceed the WF-MAX caps above.

| Runtime | Native limit/config surface | Harness rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Code | Official docs describe subagent caps for session total `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_SUBAGENTS_PER_SESSION` (default 200), concurrency `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONCURRENT_SUBAGENTS` (default 20), and spawn depth `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_SUBAGENT_SPAWN_DEPTH` (default 3); use current Claude Code agent/subagent settings when available. | Record the detected limit/source when known; Harness WF-MAX caps still apply unless the user approves a task-local override. Do not raise environment limits without user approval. |
| Codex | Official manual documents `[agents].max_concurrent_threads_per_session`; `agents.max_threads` is a legacy alias. Local codex-cli 0.144.x can reject scalar `[agents]` caps from project `.codex/config.toml` during TUI `skills/list`. | Do not scaffold Codex scalar agent caps into `.codex/config.toml`. Probe the installed runtime first; Harness manages a conservative task-local cap through the dispatch ledger unless `codex --strict-config doctor` verifies the config shape. |
| OpenCode | Official config uses `subagent_depth`; default `1` permits primary -> subagent but blocks subagent -> subagent. `0` disables subagent launches; `2` permits one nested manager -> worker level. No official concurrent-count cap was found in the current docs. | Generated config sets `subagent_depth = 2`; Harness manages total/per-wave counts through WF-MAX caps and manager `permission.task` allowlists. |

## Organization Model

```
CEO(1) -> Manager_1(span) -> Worker_1..n
       -> Manager_2(span) -> Worker_1..n
```

## D-GATE

D-GATE is mandatory before implementation waves per [WF-KERNEL.md](WF-KERNEL.md) dispatch packet format: dispatch table, AC IDs, disjoint file claims, self-audit, reviewer plan. CEO may NOT proceed to W2 implementation dispatch with a failing gate.

## Overflow

1. Current runtime subagents first.
2. Close completed agents; fill idle slots immediately.
3. Cross-CLI overflow: use an available peer CLI with explicit dispatch packets: `claude -p`, `codex exec`, or `opencode run --agent <role> --dir .`.
4. Bounded-pass fallback only when subagents and overflow are exhausted.
5. Codex compatibility guard: do not write scalar `[agents]` capacity fields into project `.codex/config.toml` by default. Probe the installed version first; local codex-cli 0.144.x has been observed to reject those fields during TUI `skills/list`. Harness manages Codex WF-MAX concurrency through the dispatch ledger and asks the user before any project/global Codex config change.
6. Do not rely on Codex++, undocumented config, environment variables, forked/derived conversations, or third-party forks as stable capacity.
