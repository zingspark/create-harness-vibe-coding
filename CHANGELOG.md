# Changelog

## [0.9.4] - 2026-09-14

- Publish the verified mainline as a clean, reproducible maintenance release with synchronized template manifests and package metadata.
- Keep the existing wf-ui agent terminal, wf-search, cross-runtime command surfaces, and installation safeguards covered by the release validation suite.

## [0.9.3] - 2026-09-13

- Add `/wf-search` as a direct, cross-runtime evidence-backed research command with fact, verify, compare, and troubleshoot modes.
- Add stateless ledger validation and Markdown rendering with bounded search/read budgets, citation integrity, uncertainty handling, URL normalization, and safe escaping.
- Add project/global runtime discovery, optional controller-only save targets, task evidence indexing, and protection for `Harness/research/search/**` during updates and removal.
- Register the command across Claude Code, OpenCode, and Codex compatibility surfaces with mirrored Skill references and installation coverage.
- Preserve the verified wf-ui runtime and agent-terminal behavior while extending the release checks for the new command.

## [0.9.2] - 2026-09-09

- Bind dispatched progress and result reporting to the service-issued worker capability and the current dispatch attempt, preserving canonical request/reply correlation and rejecting caller-forged identity.
- Add native-first runtime model capability checks with explicit operator-configured extensions, exact provider/model identity, and fail-closed unverified or unavailable outcomes without silent model substitution.
- Preserve requested effort and provider-native variants across PTY and structured chat launch/retry paths for Codex app-server, Claude stream-json, and OpenCode server adapters, with settings declarations protected from ordinary HTTP mutation.
- Keep wf-ui agent-terminal and detached-backend handoff behavior covered by the release checks while retaining the existing ConPTY cleanup path.
- Add bounded task-context, memory, research-policy, and route-budget regression checks with self-contained test fixtures; the observed cache route remains guarded by the frozen 36,000-byte limit.
- Candidate verification remains bounded: the remaining intelligence goals, fresh-provider coverage, and real post-release benchmark are not claimed complete by this release entry.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-09-08

- Unify task lifecycle around `active`, `blocked`, and `closed`, while preserving compatibility with legacy task statuses and allowing multiple open tasks with one deterministic active focus.
- Make explicit `/wf` and `/wf-max` task ownership sticky across sessions; direct, `wf-auto`, `wf-auto-spark`, `wf-review`, and `wf-browser` tasks remain outside the durable WF lifecycle unless explicitly entered with WF.
- Add project-level task grouping, tags, dates, dependency-aware routing, `INDEX.json`/`INDEX.md`, and queryable task views so agents can load the relevant project context on demand.
- Update wf-ui project and task views to expose active-task focus, WF-managed resume state, project counts, and task metadata without introducing a second persistence layer.
- Simplify the Skills Hub surface by removing the unstable Market/install panel from the primary workflow view while retaining the standalone market module for compatibility.
- Harden `wf-learn` as a command contract: load the routed memory first, separate instance facts from reusable methods, and require a `Probe -> Identify -> Act -> Verify` workflow with counterexample checks to prevent overfitting.
- Keep `wf-review` on native Harness review agents with bounded fan-out and cross-review evidence, without delegating review execution to external CLI helpers.

## [0.8.21] - 2026-08-28

- Add global-first install flow: `npm i -g create-harness-vibe-coding` once per machine, then `create-harness-vibe-coding init .` (or the new `/wf-init` direct command) per project; the global runtime is the single version source of truth and each project keeps only bridge docs plus its own state. `init --scope project` keeps the classic full project-level install for self-contained repos.
- Slim the npm package from 17.9 MB to 7.8 MB by shipping without frontend sourcemaps and dev-only UI sources; the wf-ui runtime bundle keeps full functionality.
- Make the startup update hook silent for patch-only releases (x.y.Z): only major and minor updates prompt the user to run `/wf-update`; unparseable versions still fail open with a notice.

## [0.8.20] - 2026-08-28

- Ship the wf-ui workflow canvas as a full agent-team surface: goal, event, timer, display, and capability node types with typed action surfaces, skills hub, magnetic docking, and undoable versioned graph edits.
- Add agent team cooperation: structured peer requests with request ids, timer wakeup delivery, runtime-aware role profiles, and a subagent strategy matrix covering built-in helpers and visible wf-node agents with depth resume docking.
- Consolidate all agent actions into a single `Harness/a2a/action-registry.json` source of truth (72 actions) with loader validation, derived `help --json`/`manuals` surfaces, and structural anti-drift tests against ghost/phantom actions.
- Upgrade the file node with xlsx/pdf/zip format adapters, preview caching, write locks, `file.changed` watch broadcasts, and security hardening (Zip Slip guards, entry/size clamps, per-page PDF reads).
- Rebuild markdown rendering on a shared markdown-it pipeline with lazy CDN mermaid (SRI-pinned, offline fallback), KaTeX, GFM task lists, and preview toggles for node cards, file big view, and the fullscreen editor.
- Add task capsule groups with `--group`/`--by-group` filtering and whole-group batch archive, plus a task group index for grouped overviews.
- Add real PTY-backed chat sessions (chat driver, Claude stream-json support, WS chat events) alongside terminal-based agent control.
- Harden wf-ui terminal orchestration: full terminal input control, Codex rollout-id capture via PTY scan and sessions-dir polling, PTY resource usage reporting, and per-session terminal transcript ranges.
- Fix `/wf-ui` direct command startup by adding detached server handoff, so OpenCode command timeouts do not stop the local control panel.
- Preserve Agent terminal output when the drawer is minimized and restored by keeping the xterm instance mounted and replaying only missing terminal history.
- Harden Windows PTY launch under detached UI servers by using the bundled ConPTY cleanup path by default, avoiding `AttachConsole failed` noise from the Homebridge PTY helper.
- Detect Codex CLI update menus inside Harness-managed PTY sessions and let the wf-ui terminal prompt the user to skip this session or skip until the next version.
- Add wf-ui storage cleanup controls for stopped session logs and detached launch temp logs, with retention settings and safer workflow node hover feedback.

## [0.8.19] - 2026-07-30

- Publish `$wf-ui` as the Harness control panel with task capsule observability, agent workflow hierarchy, runtime detection, real PTY-backed detected CLI launches, and multi-terminal peer sessions.
- Bundle built `wf-ui` assets in the npm package and guard them with pack smoke coverage so installed `wf-ui` can serve the browser UI without a local frontend build.
- Harden OTA updates with `--repair` mode so an already-version-bumped install can still diff and restore missing framework files such as `/wf-task-list`, `/wf-help`, and platform mirrors.
- Add post-update manifest validation: `/wf-update` now requires `validate-harness.mjs --manifest-audit` after apply/finalize to catch missing framework files, stale Harness-owned files, and manifest coverage gaps.
- Add multi-scope `/wf-update` routing: project installs update project + discovered global runtime, while uninstalled projects using global command surfaces update only the global runtime and host copies.
- Add `sync-host-global.mjs` so global Claude/Codex/OpenCode command and skill copies are audited and repaired after runtime updates.
- Keep `--repair` safe by refusing older remote sources and prerelease sources by default; repair can restore missing files but cannot silently downgrade a newer install.
- Regenerate ownership manifests from the template source so `.claude`, `.codex`, `.agents`, `.opencode`, and Harness script/spec files are tracked as updateable framework files while tasks, memory, progress, and project user files remain preserved.
- Keep `/wf-remove` aligned with manifest safety: framework-owned files can be removed safely, but user data paths such as `Harness/tasks/**`, `Harness/memory/**`, and project memory/progress files are never auto-deleted.
- Make `check:mirrors` fail cleanly on unpublished 0.8.19 mirrors without forcing a Windows process abort.

## [0.8.18] - 2026-07-29

- Add explicit task capsule management with list, archive, record/open state recovery, create-or-resume matching, task dependency metadata, and validator coverage.
- Add `wf-command-create` as the atomic command/skill creation workflow so new Harness commands update command files, skills, templates, mirrors, validators, and tests together.
- Add global install metadata for Claude, Codex, and OpenCode while keeping Harness tasks and progress project-local.
- Separate project/global memory and settings policy, with project settings taking precedence and task capsules remaining project-scoped.
- Harden host-global ownership and validation rules so framework-owned global command/skill files can update safely while user-authored files remain protected.
- Strengthen `wf-review`, `wf-agents-docs`, and WF-MAX guidance around explicit WF triggers, bounded peer output, and task capsule recording.

## [0.8.17] - 2026-07-26

- Add HarnessBench v0.2 as an external-only lifecycle proof: 15 runs per mode, direct file writes safe in 3/15 runs, Harness safe path safe in 15/15 runs.
- Keep benchmark fixtures, raw results, and scorer scripts out of generated installs and npm package files while publishing the summary in README and README-CN.
- Make `wf-browser` the built-in browser automation entry and retire `browser-e2e` as a warning no-op optional id.
- Add `wf-help` compatibility surfaces for Claude, Codex, and OpenCode with guards against nonexistent OpenCode skill paths.
- Harden WF-MAX fan-out docs and OpenCode manager allowlists while preserving the Codex config guard against unsupported scalar subagent caps.
- Add deterministic task-state/archive reconciliation tooling and validators for active task consistency.

## [0.8.16] - 2026-07-23

- Fix `scan-clean` default source selection so it honors the installed `Harness/.harness-version.source` before falling back to npm/GitHub, preventing false dead-file reports before npm publish catches up.
- Register `/wf-update` in `Harness/MEMORY.md` as a direct command and add validator coverage for the route.
- Clean `wf-remove.mjs` human-readable output to remove replacement characters and add a validator guard against future encoding pollution.

## [0.8.15] - 2026-07-23

- Add real Claude Code L2 prompt-cache telemetry via `Harness/scripts/l2-cache-telemetry.mjs`, including bounded provider-control, thin-startup, and `/wf` light-route probes.
- Record the measured cache result in README: harness-thin warm median cache read `98.7%` (`+5.4` percentage points vs provider-control) and `/wf` wf-light `99.1%` (`+5.8` percentage points), with the raw local report path and the exact usage-field formula.
- Add cache regression gates: L0 structure checks, L1 SHA-256 stable-prefix simulation, L2 claim-gated provider telemetry, and context-budget guards for route profiles.
- Tighten startup routing: normal sessions stay thin (`CLAUDE.md` + `Harness/memory/startup-hints.md`), `Harness/specs/guides/SETUP.md` is retained only as install/bootstrap/migration/upgrade reference, and `Harness/README.md` remains the routed workflow router.
- Add `wf-agents-docs` CLI invocation guidance for Claude Code, Codex, and OpenCode automation, including JSON telemetry parsing and cache-attribution boundaries.
- Align `/wf-update` direct commands with the 8-step safe update flow: safe apply first, script-recorded conflict decisions, finalize only after conflicts are resolved, then validate and scan.
- Harden update/remove consistency: remove script recognizes new built-in agents/skills, updater keeps `Harness/specs/guides/SETUP.md` instead of treating it as disposable bootstrap debt, and validators catch route/cache/update drift.

## [0.8.14] - 2026-07-22

- Introduce `Harness/ownership.manifest.json` as the machine-readable source of truth for install/update file classification; auto-generated by `node scripts/build-version.mjs` from `templates/common/` + `templates/optional/catalog.json`, manifest-first with content-marker fallback for old installs.
- Fix optional-skill collision: user same-name skills (e.g. `browser-e2e`) are no longer overwritten when the option is not installed (`optionalOwned` → `safe-if-installed`).
- Normalize line endings via `.gitattributes` so `git diff --check` stays clean across Windows/POSIX.
- Release gate reminder: legacy `zingspark` mirror sync AND `npm publish` must both complete before announcing an update as available to existing users.
- Install collision guard: same-name user-authored agents/commands/skills are preserved under overwrite/backup/skip and surface as conflicts under fail; only files carrying a Harness ownership marker upgrade, and a warning names each preserved user file.
- Tighten Harness-ownership detection: drop the broad `/wf` substring marker that false-matched user files merely mentioning `/wf`; frontmatter and specific identity markers remain.
- Docs: align `/wf-update` command and skill with updater behavior — carry-forward covers all merge-tier files (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, MEMORY.md, Harness/MEMORY.md, Harness/README.md), root README.md is PRESERVE while Harness/README.md is merge-tier, and safe-apply covers SAFE/NEW/adopted files.
- Release gate: legacy mirror must also publish the tag's GitHub Release, not only commit/tag/manifest.
- Carry forward unchanged accepted CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md conflict decisions so update checks do not re-ask for the same keep-local choice every release.
- Detect existing untracked Harness-owned agent/command/skill files by content markers before overwriting; same-name user files remain real conflicts.
- Add `harness: wf-agent` markers to built-in agent frontmatter for future content-based ownership checks.
- Prepare SAFE/NEW update files concurrently while preserving all-or-nothing checksum validation before writing.

## [0.8.13] - 2026-07-22

- Make Harness updates resolve from npm `create-harness-vibe-coding@latest` first, with `LiWeny16/create-harness-vibe-coding` as the canonical GitHub fallback and `zingspark/create-harness-vibe-coding` as the legacy mirror fallback.
- Keep generated installs on the canonical `LiWeny16` source while requiring `zingspark` legacy mirror sync for old updaters.
- Make `--apply-safe` validate all remote hashes before writing any SAFE/NEW files.
- Force the latest install CLI's existing-Harness update switch to pass the canonical `LiWeny16` source to older updater scripts.

## [0.8.12] - 2026-07-22

- Add validator, generator, E2E, pack-smoke, and CI/pre-push coverage for startup-only update checks.
- Reject drive-letter paths in Harness update/remove/clean scripts across platforms.

## [0.8.9] - 2026-07-17
