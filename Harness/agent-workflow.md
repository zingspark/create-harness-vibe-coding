# Agent Workflow

Use when implementing, reviewing, debugging, or coordinating subagents.

## ReAct Loop

```text
Observe -> Load minimal context -> Plan -> Act -> Verify -> Update Harness/tasks/<task-id>/PROGRESS.md
```

If context grows, load [context-loading.md](context-loading.md) and split the work. If more than one agent is useful, load [subagents.md](subagents.md) and [dispatch.md](dispatch.md).

## Feature Packet

Every PRD scope item must be covered by a task plan at `Harness/tasks/<task-id>/PLAN.md`
created from `Harness/tasks/_template/PLAN.md` (the primary work tracking system).
`Harness/features/_template.md` is a legacy alternative; prefer tasks/ for new work.

**Cohesion rule**: if multiple PRD scope items share the same write set, the same
test/verification path, and the same review boundary, group them into a single
feature doc. The PRD owns scope decomposition; the feature doc owns the
implementation unit. The number of feature docs should reflect the number of
distinguishable implementation units, not the number of PRD checkboxes.

**Minimum bar**: a feature doc is still required when the implementation touches
more than one file or changes user-visible behavior. Only skip a feature doc
entirely when the work is a single-file fix with no behavior change — in that
case, record the change in `Harness/tasks/<task-id>/PLAN.md` instead.

**New vs iterate**: if a PRD scope item has >=85% overlap with an existing feature doc, open the existing doc, bump `Version`, and add a `## Changelog` entry. Only create a new file when the scope is substantially different. When unsure, ask.

## Standard Build Loop

```text
PRD/feature packet
-> failing test or manual check
-> minimal implementation
-> verification
-> review
-> docs sync
-> close or iterate
```

## Subagent Use

Use subagents when a task needs broad reading, parallel work, cross-layer changes, independent review, or isolated debugging. Follow [subagents.md](subagents.md) for controller-led orchestration and [dispatch.md](dispatch.md) for the dispatch table.

Before spawn, define:

- role
- task
- mode
- read boundary
- write boundary
- dependency
- injected docs from [context-loading.md](context-loading.md)
- return format

Rules:

- Explorer Pass, Reviewer, and Verifier are read-only.
- Researcher and Docs Researcher are read-only unless explicitly asked to return a docs patch.
- Planner and Architect are read-only unless explicitly asked to return a docs patch.
- Test Writer writes tests before Implementer writes production code.
- Implementer only writes inside its declared write set.
- Writing agents run serially unless write sets are disjoint.
- Debugger fixes the smallest failing path, not adjacent design.
- Main agent integrates summaries, resolves conflicts, and runs final verification.

## Parallel Dispatch

Use [subagents.md](subagents.md) and [dispatch.md](dispatch.md) for multi-agent work. Default to at most three active agents (WF mode overrides this; see [WF.md](WF.md)). In `/wf max`, the CEO/Manager/Worker hierarchy in [WF-MAX.md](WF-MAX.md) overrides this limit entirely with wave-based parallel dispatch. Prefer parallel read-only work first, then serial writes.

Every dispatched agent returns the handoff format defined in [dispatch.md](dispatch.md).

## Conflict Rule

If PRD, task PLAN.md, architecture, ports, tests, or code disagree:

1. stop implementation
2. record the conflict in `Harness/tasks/<task-id>/PROGRESS.md` or the feature doc
3. choose the smallest reversible decision
4. ask the maintainer when user-visible behavior or security is affected

## Completion Gate

Close only when:

- acceptance criteria are satisfied
- verification evidence is recorded
- architecture, ports, data-flow, or state docs are synced if affected
- no unresolved critical/high review findings remain
- any optimistic UI mutation has a declared and verified rollback path
- any file declared as DONE in PLAN.md or PROGRESS.md exists on disk (chat output is not durable evidence)
- `Harness/tasks/<task-id>/PROGRESS.md` states the final status or next iteration
