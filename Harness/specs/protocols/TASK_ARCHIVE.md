# TASK_ARCHIVE - Task Archive Mechanism

Purpose: keep `Harness/tasks/` lean by archiving completed/abandoned tasks while
preserving all evidence.

## Archive Location

Active tasks stay in `Harness/tasks/<task-id>/`.
Archived tasks move to `Harness/tasks/_archive/YYYY/MM/DD/<task-id>/`.

## What Is Never Archived

- `Harness/tasks/_template/` - scaffold template, never moved.
- `Harness/tasks/continuous/` - WF-AUTO/WF-AUTO-SPARK permanent state capsule, never moved unless
  explicitly allowed by WF-AUTO docs.
- `Harness/tasks/_archive/` - the archive directory itself.
- Active or blocked tasks.
- Legacy `in_progress`, `running`, `pending`, and `needs-user-decision` values
  are treated as open during migration.

## What May Be Archived

Tasks whose STATE.json or reconciled phase is `closed` may be archived.
Legacy completed values such as `complete`, `verified`, `done`, and `closeout`
remain readable and archiveable.

`Harness/scripts/task-state.mjs` reads STATE.json `status`/`phase` first, then
uses root/task PROGRESS phases only as reconciliation evidence. Missing or
invalid STATE.json is skipped until
`node Harness/scripts/task-state.mjs reconcile --apply` creates or repairs
machine state.

## Archive Process

1. Verify the task is not active or blocked (including legacy open aliases).
2. Ensure `Harness/tasks/_archive/YYYY/MM/DD/` exists.
3. Move `Harness/tasks/<task-id>/` to
   `Harness/tasks/_archive/YYYY/MM/DD/<task-id>/`.
4. Update the moved STATE.json: `status` to `archived`, `phase` to `archived`
   as an archive-record marker; live task lifecycle writes use `closed`.
5. Update `Harness/tasks/_archive/INDEX.md`.
6. Rewrite `Harness/PROGRESS.md` Task Index from the remaining non-archived
   task capsules.

## Retention

- Archived tasks retain: PLAN, PROGRESS, STATE, ARTIFACTS, NOTES.
- Do NOT delete historical evidence.
- `Harness/PROGRESS.md` keeps the last 5 non-archived task entries in the Task
  Index.
- When outer task capsules exceed 5 completed/abandoned/obsolete tasks, remind
  the user to run the task archive command. Do not auto-archive during unrelated
  validation or closeout unless the user explicitly invokes archive apply mode.
- The validator (`Harness/scripts/validate-harness.mjs`) warns when
  `Harness/tasks/` holds more than 5 outer task capsules (excluding `_archive`,
  `_template`, `auto`) and fails in `--strict` mode.

## Script

User-facing command:

- Codex: `$wf-task-archive` or `/skills wf-task-archive`.
- Claude Code/OpenCode: `/wf-task-archive`.

Underlying implementation: `Harness/scripts/task-state.mjs archive`.

- Default: dry-run (respects `--keep` cap, archives oldest-eligible up to cap).
- `--apply` to execute.
- Explicit `--apply` with no `--task` filter: archives **ALL** eligible tasks, bypassing `--keep`.
- `--keep 5` to set the non-archived task threshold.
- `--task <task-id>` to archive a specific task.
- `--json` for machine-readable output.
- After archiving, `Harness/tasks/_archive/INDEX.md` is regenerated with a full
  task graph: roots, dependency chains, blocks relationships, and per-task details
  (status, phase, goal, depends-on, blocks). The graph covers **all** archived tasks
  across all years, so it stays accurate as tasks accumulate.
- Run `node Harness/scripts/task-state.mjs archive --dry-run --json` before
  applying a risky cleanup.

Compatibility entry: `Harness/scripts/archive-tasks.mjs` delegates to
`task-state.mjs archive` and accepts the same archive flags.

## Safety Rules

- Windows path safe. Use `path.resolve()` before moving.
- Confirm target is within `Harness/tasks/` before any move.
- Do NOT recursively delete.
- Tasks with `blocked` status (including legacy `needs-user-decision` and
  `failed`) are never auto-archived.
- Missing or invalid STATE.json is never archived without reconciliation.
