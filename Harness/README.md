# create-harness-vibe-coding - Harness Router

Purpose: route humans and agents to the smallest useful context. `CLAUDE.md` is the session entry router; `Harness/README.md` is the primary Harness documentation router.

Default load: `CLAUDE.md`. Workflow commands (`/wf`, `/wf-max`, `/wf-auto`, `/wf-review`, `/wf-learn`, `/wf-readme`, `/wf-remove`, `/wf-browser`, `/wf-auto-spark`) also load `Harness/MEMORY.md` (index only), this file, and `Harness/PROGRESS.md` when work is active.

`/wf-help` `$wf-help` `/skills wf-help`, `/wf-update` `$wf-update` `/skills wf-update`, `/wf-task-record` `$wf-task-record` `/skills wf-task-record`, `/wf-task-list` `$wf-task-list` `/skills wf-task-list`, `/wf-task-archive` `$wf-task-archive` `/skills wf-task-archive`, `/wf-command-create` `$wf-command-create` `/skills wf-command-create`, `/wf-ui` `$wf-ui` `/skills wf-ui`, `/wf-init` `$wf-init` `/skills wf-init`, `/wf-search` `$wf-search` `/skills wf-search` are **direct/compat commands**: skip router, skip `Harness/MEMORY.md`, never enter WF. Claude/OpenCode use command files; Codex uses shims.

Do not read the whole `Harness/` tree.

## Resume Routing / Active Task Resume

`Harness/PROGRESS.md` is the global active pointer. `Harness/tasks/<task-id>/STATE.json` is the machine-readable resume entry.

On session start (new window, reopen, resume):
1. If the user says "continue", "resume", "last task", "current task", "status", or the work is not a simple direct task, read `Harness/PROGRESS.md`.
2. Find the Active Task, then read `Harness/tasks/<active-task>/STATE.json` first.
3. From STATE.json, determine:
   - Current phase — what was in progress
   - activeQuestion — is a user answer needed before proceeding?
   - ready queue — can work be dispatched immediately?
   - running items — need result confirmation?
   - blocked — what's blocking?
   - nextAction — what to do next
4. Do NOT discover context by reading all task directories. Use the active pointer.
5. Check `links.dependsOn` and `links.blocks` in STATE.json for cross-task
   dependency resolution — read only the listed tasks' STATE.json, not all
   task capsules.
6. Direct simple tasks may skip STATE/PLAN/PROGRESS unless the user says "continue"/"resume".

See `Harness/specs/workflows/WF-STATE.md` for the full state machine contract and enums. `/wf-task-list` exposes dependencies and open tasks.

## Direct Mode (Degradation Path)

When the user does NOT explicitly invoke `/wf-*`, `$wf-*`, `/skills wf-*`, or say `wf` / `wf-max`, the request is handled in **direct mode**. Skip the router entirely. Execute the task. Do not load `Harness/MEMORY.md`, `Harness/README.md`, or `Harness/PROGRESS.md`.

Complex work may use direct planning, task capsules, tests, and subagents without entering WF.

Escalate to the router (next section) only when:
- User explicitly invokes `/wf`, `/wf-max`, `$wf`, `$wf-max`, `/skills wf`, `/skills wf-max`, or says `wf` / `wf-max`
- User invokes another workflow `/wf-*`, `$wf-*`, or `/skills wf-*` command, excluding direct/compat commands listed in `Harness/specs/runtime/command-surface.json`

Direct/compat commands are executed immediately without router load.

## 0-1 Flow

```text
Idea -> Research -> Mini PRD -> Acceptance Criteria -> Contracts -> Tests -> Build -> Independent Validation -> Debug -> Memory
```

For the full phase contract, load [lifecycle.md](specs/guides/lifecycle.md).

## Development Contract

- This file is a router, not a full spec.
- If the task does not clearly match a row below, search by keywords before loading more docs.
- project files are the only durable communication channel; chat/subagent transcript state is non-authoritative.
- Write assumptions, decisions, blockers, evidence, and handoffs to the current task docs, feature doc, `Harness/MEMORY.md`, or `Harness/memory/*`.
- Task records are compact by default: PLAN holds goal, decisions, scope, risks; PROGRESS holds status/next, changes, verification. Link logs/transcripts instead of pasting them.
- Build commands, git conventions, and release notes belong in root `README.md`, not `CLAUDE.md`.
- README rewrites are optional project-doc work. Use `wf-readme` and preserve existing public docs unless the user approves a broader restructure.
- Code architecture belongs in [architecture.md](project/architecture.md) or the current feature doc, not `CLAUDE.md`.
- Core rules live in `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/rules/ecc/common.md`.
- WF mode rules live in [WF.md](specs/workflows/WF.md).
- Phase rules live in [lifecycle.md](specs/guides/lifecycle.md).
- Build, review, test, and subagent rules live in [agent-workflow.md](specs/runtime/agent-workflow.md); AC-linked TDD rules live in [TDD-GUIDE.md](specs/protocols/TDD-GUIDE.md).
- Acceptance-driven gates live in [ACCEPTANCE_PROTOCOL.md](specs/protocols/ACCEPTANCE_PROTOCOL.md). PRD-derived Acceptance Criteria are the source of truth for implementation, tests, review, validation, debug, and memory.
- Role/context isolation rules live in [AGENT_ISOLATION.md](specs/protocols/AGENT_ISOLATION.md).
- Frontend-backend test harness and CDP/network evidence rules live in [HARNESS_BRIDGE.md](specs/protocols/HARNESS_BRIDGE.md).
- Parallel dispatch rules live in [dispatch.md](specs/runtime/dispatch.md).
- Subagent orchestration methodology lives in [subagents.md](specs/runtime/subagents.md).
- Extension rules live in [extension.md](specs/guides/extension.md).
- Context-loading rules live in [context-loading.md](specs/runtime/context-loading.md).
- Progress lives in `Harness/PROGRESS.md`, `Harness/tasks/<task-id>/PROGRESS.md`, `Harness/tasks/<task-id>/PLAN.md`, and the current feature doc.

## Keyword Routing

Use this only when the task is ambiguous or the matching row is unclear.

1. Extract 2-5 concrete keywords from the user request.
2. Search the project docs first:

```bash
rg -n "keyword1|keyword2|keyword3" CLAUDE.md README.md Harness
```

3. Load only the top matching doc or the smallest matching doc pair.
4. If keyword search conflicts with the table below, follow the table and record the assumption in `Harness/tasks/<task-id>/PROGRESS.md`.

Keywords are retrieval hints, not project facts.

## Load By Task

Load the matching row only. Add adjacent docs only when the loaded doc directly names them.

Routing priority: **direct mode is the default** without an explicit WF token. Complex tasks may still plan, test, and use subagents outside WF. Explicit WF tokens (`/wf`, `$wf`, `/skills wf`, `/wf-max`, `$wf-max`, `/skills wf-max`) enter WF. Tiers: **WF-Light** (low-risk `/wf`), **WF-Standard** (multi-file or behavior change), **WF-Full** (high-risk/cross-layer/security/data-loss/browser/API/ambiguous architecture). `/wf-max`: **WF-Max-Useful** by default, **WF-Max-Strict** only with strict override.

## Gates

- Move phases in order unless the user asks for a fast lane.
- Use `/wf <task>` in Claude Code or `$wf` in Codex, or `/wf-max [task]` / `$wf-max` for maximum-parallelism mode. WF mode is explicit only. WF-Light for low-risk, WF-Standard for multi-file, WF-Full for high-risk/cross-layer. `/wf-max` defaults to useful-fanout (WF-Max-Useful); use explicit `--strict` or "strict wf-max" for unconditional fan-out (WF-Max-Strict).
- Use `/wf-auto` for perpetual self-directed optimization. It selects probes from project evidence and stops only after dynamic risk obligations and two different empty confirmation passes are recorded.
- **WF-MAX Role Contract**: Three-layer architecture: global mode (`wf-max`), agent role (`ceo|manager|worker|verifier|reviewer|reflector`), dispatch permission (`writeSet`, `forbidden`, `verification`). CEO never writes source code. Workers edit only dispatch.writeSet. Compliance is checked through dispatch packets, independent review, validation evidence, and task capsules. See `CLAUDE.md#1a`.
- **WF-REVIEW Independence**: Use only the installed Harness-native `reviewer` role as a separate clean subagent context. The controller may choose bounded native fan-out, but `wf-review` must not invoke peer CLIs or allow reviewer recursion; the main agent owns final decisions.
- WF-MAX role enforcement has no runtime hook state. Durable WF state remains the task capsule, dispatch table, review findings, and validation evidence. Startup update-check hooks do not enforce roles, write sets, or agent identity. The `/wf-auto` bounded tick hook is described in `WF-AUTO.md`.
- Do not code before PRD-GATE, AC-GATE, CONTRACT-GATE, and TEST-GATE are satisfied or explicitly compressed into a documented fast lane.
- PRD-derived Acceptance Criteria are the source of truth. Code, tests, reviews, validation, debug, and memory must trace to AC IDs.
- No acceptance criteria, no tests. No acceptance criteria, no code.
- No `data-testid` or stable accessible selector, no UI acceptance. No API contract, no backend integration acceptance.
- Unsure whether to open a task? Read [agent-workflow.md](specs/runtime/agent-workflow.md) Section 1.
- Do not spawn a subagent without a role, read boundary, write boundary, and return contract.
- Do not run writing agents in parallel unless write sets are disjoint.
- Before coordinating multiple agents, fill `Harness/tasks/<task-id>/PLAN.md#Subagent Dispatch` and follow `subagents.md` plus `dispatch.md`; if the work also matches WF triggers, enter WF mode first.
- In WF mode, update `Harness/tasks/<task-id>/PROGRESS.md#Heartbeat` before long commands, after failures, and at closeout.
- In WF Max mode, never dispatch two implementers with overlapping file claims. Verify disjointness before each wave.
- In WF Max mode, D-GATE (Dispatch Table + Self-Audit Checklist) is mandatory before W2 implementation dispatch.
- Do not add stack-specific agents or skills without following `extension.md`.
- Do not close work without tests or recorded manual verification.
- Do not mark work `Verified` until evidence is recorded, cross-review has passed, and reflector verdict is PASS.
- Run `node Harness/scripts/validate-harness.mjs` for install-complete scaffold structure; run `node Harness/scripts/validate-harness.mjs --strict` only after bootstrap resolves project-fact placeholders and before release.
- If a doc still has `{{...}}`, treat that section as a template, not project fact.

## Direct Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/wf-help`, `$wf-help` | Returns a table of all Harness WF commands, usage, and purpose. Claude Code/OpenCode use direct command files; Codex uses the minimal `wf-help` skill shim. It never starts WF. |
| `/wf-update`, `$wf-update` | Script-driven harness update: fetch + compare + apply + report release highlights. Direct command for Claude Code and OpenCode; skill path available for Codex compatibility. |
| `/wf-task-record`, `$wf-task-record` | Record progress, decisions, and evidence to the active task capsule. Direct/compat — no Harness/MEMORY.md load. |
| `/wf-task-list`, `$wf-task-list` | List tasks with dependency view, open tasks filter, and archive summary. Direct/compat — no Harness/MEMORY.md load. |
| `/wf-task-archive`, `$wf-task-archive` | Archive completed/verified task capsules. Direct/compat — no Harness/MEMORY.md load. |
| `/wf-command-create`, `$wf-command-create` | Create or modify wf-* command surfaces from `command-surface.json`. Direct/compat — creates/resumes a task capsule, no Harness/MEMORY.md load. |
| `/wf-ui`, `$wf-ui` | Start the local Harness backend and browser control panel. Direct/compat
| `/wf-init`, `$wf-init` | Initialize this project against the globally installed Harness runtime (thin bridge + project-local state). Direct/compat — no Harness/MEMORY.md load. |
| `/wf-search`, `$wf-search` | Structured search command: run a real tool search as a validated ledger (operations/sources/claims) and render an evidence report via `Harness/scripts/wf-search.mjs`. Direct/compat — no Harness/MEMORY.md load. |

## Skill Commands

Workflow commands: `/wf`, `/wf-max`, `/wf-auto`, `/wf-auto-spark`, `/wf-review`, `/wf-learn`, `/wf-browser`, `/wf-readme`, `/wf-remove` with matching Codex `$...` and `/skills ...` forms. They load `Harness/MEMORY.md` and follow the registered task capsule policy. `/wf-update`, `/wf-ui`, and `/wf-init` remain direct, as does `/wf-search` (`$wf-search` / `/skills wf-search`): the direct search command validates and renders a structured evidence report without entering WF.
